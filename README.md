# ofm-population-updates

The files in this reository are intended to help with downloading and processing child population data from the Office of Financial Management (OFM) in Washignton State for Partners for Our Children (POC).

## get_cleaned_population_estimates

This is the master script for this repository and it reads all functions into memory, checks to see if OFM population data has been downloaded, downloads data if it hasn't been and cleans up the data for use by POC.
